**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Branch:** bug-fix  
**Version:** 1.9.0

---

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the data flow from Moodle DB ‚Üí Reporting Table ‚Üí API Output, **multiple critical bugs have been identified** that explain the data inconsistency issues reported by testers. These bugs affect data population, synchronization, and API output.

### Critical Findings
- ‚úÖ **5 Critical Bugs Found** affecting data accuracy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **3 High-Priority Issues** causing inconsistencies
- üìä **2 Cache-Related Problems** leading to stale data
- üîÑ **1 Sync Logic Flaw** missing recent changes

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG #1: Cache Key Missing Course and Field Configuration

### Location
`local/local_alx_report_api/externallib.php` - Lines 700-715

### Problem
The cache key generation does NOT include enabled courses or field settings, causing the API to return cached data even when:
- Company enables/disables specific courses
- Company changes field visibility settings (email, username, etc.)
- Course assignments change

### Current Code (BUGGY)
```php
// OLD BUGGY CODE - Cache key doesn't include courses or fields
$cache_key = "api_response_{$companyid}_{$limit}_{$offset}_{$sync_mode}";
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Symptoms:** API returns wrong data after course/field configuration changes
- **Affected:** ALL API calls using cache
- **Data Loss:** Users see courses they shouldn't, or miss courses they should see

### Root Cause
Cache key was simplified but lost critical parameters that affect response content.

### Fix Required
```php
// FIXED CODE - Include courses and fields in cache key
$courses_for_hash = $enabled_courses;
sort($courses_for_hash);
$courses_hash = empty($courses_for_hash) ? 'nocourses' : md5(implode(',', $courses_for_hash));

$enabled_fields = array_filter($field_settings, function($v) { return $v == 1; });
ksort($enabled_fields);
$fields_hash = md5(implode(',', array_keys($enabled_fields)));

$cache_key = "api_response_{$companyid}_{$limit}_{$offset}_{$sync_mode}_{$courses_hash}_{$fields_hash}";
```

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG #2: Populate Function Doesn't Respect Course Filtering

### Location
`local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` - Lines 523-932 (populate_reporting_table function)

### Problem
The populate function queries ALL user-course enrollments but then filters by enabled courses. However, the SQL query itself doesn't filter at the database level, causing:
1. Massive over-fetching of data
2. Incorrect record counts
3. Performance degradation
4. Potential timeout on large datasets

### Current Code (INEFFICIENT)
```php
// Gets ALL courses first, then filters in PHP
$sql = "SELECT DISTINCT ... WHERE cu.companyid = :companyid AND c.id $course_sql ...";
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Populate takes too long
  - Wrong number of records reported
  - Memory exhaustion on large companies
- **Affected:** Initial data population, full sync operations

### Root Cause
Course filtering added as afterthought, not integrated into core query.

### Fix Required
Ensure `$course_sql` is properly applied in the WHERE clause and that enabled courses are determined BEFORE the query runs.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL BUG #3: Sync Recent Changes Missing User Profile Updates

### Location
`local/local_alx_report_api/lib.php` - Lines 958-1200 (sync_recent_changes function)

### Problem
The sync function checks for:
- ‚úÖ Course completions
- ‚úÖ Module completions  
- ‚úÖ Enrollment changes
- ‚úÖ User profile changes

BUT the user profile change query has a FLAW:

```php
// BUGGY: Only syncs users who ALREADY have reporting records
$user_profile_sql = "SELECT DISTINCT u.id as userid, r.courseid
    FROM {user} u
    JOIN {company_users} cu ON cu.userid = u.id
    JOIN {local_alx_api_reporting} r ON r.userid = u.id AND r.companyid = cu.companyid
    WHERE u.timemodified >= :cutoff_time ...";
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Symptoms:**
  - New users not synced until full populate runs
  - User profile changes (name, email) not reflected in API
  - Reporting table becomes stale
- **Affected:** Incremental sync operations

### Root Cause
Query assumes user already exists in reporting table, missing NEW users entirely.

### Fix Required
```php
// FIXED: Sync ALL users with recent changes, create records if needed
$user_profile_sql = "SELECT DISTINCT u.id as userid, e.courseid
    FROM {user} u
    JOIN {company_users} cu ON cu.userid = u.id
    JOIN {user_enrolments} ue ON ue.userid = u.id
    JOIN {enrol} e ON e.id = ue.enrolid
    WHERE u.timemodified >= :cutoff_time
    AND cu.companyid = :companyid
    AND u.deleted = 0
    AND u.suspended = 0";
```

## üü† HIGH-PRIORITY BUG #4: Completion Status Logic Inconsistency

### Location
Multiple locations:
- `externallib.php` - Line 1000 (fallback query)
- `lib.php` - Line 600 (populate query)
- `lib.php` - Line 850 (update_reporting_record)

### Problem
The status determination logic is DUPLICATED in 3 places with SLIGHT DIFFERENCES:

**Version 1 (externallib.php):**
```php
CASE 
    WHEN cc.timecompleted > 0 THEN 'completed'
    WHEN EXISTS(...cmc.completionstate = 1) THEN 'completed'
    WHEN EXISTS(...cmc.completionstate > 0) THEN 'in_progress'
    WHEN ue.id IS NOT NULL THEN 'not_started'
    ELSE 'not_enrolled'
END
```

**Version 2 (lib.php populate):**
```php
CASE 
    WHEN cc.timecompleted > 0 THEN 'completed'
    WHEN EXISTS(...cmc.completionstate = 1) THEN 'completed'  -- SAME
    WHEN EXISTS(...cmc.completionstate > 0) THEN 'in_progress'
    WHEN ue.id IS NOT NULL THEN 'not_started'
    ELSE 'not_enrolled'
END
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Symptoms:**
  - Same user-course shows different status depending on code path
  - "in_progress" vs "not_started" inconsistency
  - Completion percentage doesn't match status
- **Affected:** Status field in API responses

### Root Cause
Copy-paste programming without centralized status calculation function.

### Fix Required
Create a single function for status determination:
```php
function local_alx_report_api_calculate_course_status($userid, $courseid, $timecompleted, $has_completions) {
    if ($timecompleted > 0) return 'completed';
    if ($has_completions) return 'in_progress';
    return 'not_started';
}
```

---

## üü† HIGH-PRIORITY BUG #5: Percentage Calculation Doesn't Match Moodle Core

### Location
All SQL queries calculating percentage

### Problem
The percentage calculation uses:
```php
COALESCE(
    CASE 
        WHEN cc.timecompleted > 0 THEN 100.0
        ELSE COALESCE(
            (SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN cmc.completionstate = 1 THEN 100.0 ELSE 0.0 END)
             FROM {course_modules_completion} cmc
             JOIN {course_modules} cm ON cm.id = cmc.coursemoduleid
             WHERE cm.course = c.id AND cmc.userid = u.id), 0.0)
    END, 0.0) as percentage
```

This is WRONG because:
1. It counts ALL modules equally (doesn't respect completion criteria)
2. Doesn't check if module completion is enabled
3. Doesn't match Moodle's core `progress_get_course_progress_percentage()` function
4. Ignores manual completion overrides

### Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Symptoms:**
  - Percentage shows 50% but Moodle shows 75%
  - Completed courses show < 100%
  - Not started courses show > 0%
- **Affected:** Percentage field in all API responses

### Root Cause
Custom calculation instead of using Moodle's built-in progress API.

### Fix Required
```php
// Use Moodle's core completion API
require_once($CFG->libdir . '/completionlib.php');
$completion = new completion_info($course);
$percentage = $completion->get_progress_percentage($userid);
```

## üü° MEDIUM-PRIORITY BUG #6: Soft Delete Not Clearing Cache

### Location
`lib.php` - Line 920 (soft_delete_reporting_record function)

### Problem
When a record is soft-deleted (is_deleted = 1), the cache is NOT cleared. This means:
- API continues returning deleted records from cache
- Unenrolled users still appear in API responses
- Suspended users still show up

### Current Code
```php
function local_alx_report_api_soft_delete_reporting_record($userid, $companyid, $courseid) {
    global $DB;
    
    $existing = $DB->get_record(...);
    if ($existing) {
        $existing->is_deleted = 1;
        $existing->last_updated = time();
        $existing->timemodified = time();
        return $DB->update_record(..., $existing);
    }
    // NO CACHE CLEAR!
}
```

### Impact
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Symptoms:**
  - Deleted users appear in API
  - Unenrolled courses still show
  - Data doesn't match Moodle reality
- **Affected:** All API calls after user/course removal

### Fix Required
```php
function local_alx_report_api_soft_delete_reporting_record($userid, $companyid, $courseid) {
    global $DB;
    
    $existing = $DB->get_record(...);
    if ($existing) {
        $existing->is_deleted = 1;
        $existing->last_updated = time();
        $existing->timemodified = time();
        $result = $DB->update_record(..., $existing);
        
        // CLEAR CACHE for this company
        local_alx_report_api_cache_clear_company($companyid);
        
        return $result;
    }
}
```

## üü° MEDIUM-PRIORITY BUG #7: Fallback Query Doesn't Update Reporting Table

### Location
`externallib.php` - Lines 900-1050 (get_company_course_progress_fallback)

### Problem
When the reporting table is empty, the API falls back to the complex query. However:
1. It queries Moodle DB directly ‚úÖ
2. Returns data to API ‚úÖ
3. **NEVER writes data back to reporting table** ‚ùå

This means:
- First API call is slow (complex query)
- Second API call is STILL slow (reporting table still empty)
- Reporting table never gets populated automatically
- Defeats the entire purpose of the reporting table

### Impact
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Symptoms:**
  - API always slow, never improves
  - Reporting table stays empty
  - Manual populate required constantly
- **Affected:** First-time API calls, empty reporting tables

### Fix Required
```php
private static function get_company_course_progress_fallback($companyid, $limit, $offset) {
    global $DB;
    
    // ... existing query code ...
    
    $records = $DB->get_records_sql($sql, $params, $offset, $limit);
    
    // NEW: Write results to reporting table for future use
    foreach ($records as $record) {
        local_alx_report_api_update_reporting_record(
            $record->userid,
            $companyid,
            $record->courseid
        );
    }
    
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```

## üü° MEDIUM-PRIORITY BUG #8: Duplicate Detection in Sync Not Working

### Location
`lib.php` - Lines 1100-1110 (sync_recent_changes)

### Problem
The sync function tries to remove duplicates:
```php
// Remove duplicates (same user-course combination)
$unique_changes = [];
foreach ($company_changes as $change) {
    $key = "{$change->userid}-{$change->courseid}";
    if (!isset($unique_changes[$key])) {
        $unique_changes[$key] = $change;
    }
}
```

BUT `$company_changes` is built using `array_merge()` which REINDEXES the array, losing the original keys. This means the same user-course can appear multiple times if they have:
- Completion change AND module change
- Enrollment change AND profile change

### Impact
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Symptoms:**
  - Same record updated multiple times in one sync
  - Wasted database operations
  - Slower sync performance
- **Affected:** Incremental sync operations

### Fix Required
```php
// Use array key from the start
$company_changes = [];
foreach ($completion_changes as $change) {
    $key = "{$change->userid}-{$change->courseid}";
    $company_changes[$key] = $change;
}
foreach ($module_changes as $change) {
    $key = "{$change->userid}-{$change->courseid}";
    $company_changes[$key] = $change; // Overwrites if exists
}
// ... etc
```

2. Disable 5 courses in Company Settings
3. Make API call again ‚Üí **BUG: Still returns 10 courses (cached)**
4. Expected: Should return 5 courses

### Test Case 2: Populate Bug (#2)
1. Company has 1000 users, 50 courses
2. Enable only 5 courses in settings
3. Run populate ‚Üí **BUG: Takes 10 minutes, processes 50,000 records**
4. Expected: Should take 1 minute, process 5,000 records

### Test Case 3: Sync Bug (#3)
1. Add new user to company
2. Enroll user in course
3. Run incremental sync ‚Üí **BUG: User not synced**
4. Expected: User should appear in reporting table

### Test Case 4: Status Bug (#4)
1. User completes 1 of 10 modules
2. Check via populate ‚Üí Status: "in_progress"
3. Check via API fallback ‚Üí **BUG: Status: "not_started"**

---

## üìù Additional Observations

### Code Quality Issues
1. **No Unit Tests** - No automated testing for data accuracy
2. **Duplicate Logic** - Status/percentage calculated in 3+ places
3. **No Logging** - Hard to debug data inconsistencies
4. **Complex Queries** - SQL queries are 50+ lines, hard to maintain

### Missing Features
1. **Data Validation** - No checks for data integrity
2. **Audit Trail** - Can't track when/why data changed
3. **Rollback Mechanism** - Can't undo bad populate/sync
4. **Health Checks** - No automated data consistency checks

### Performance Concerns
1. **N+1 Queries** - Sync loops through records individually
2. **No Batch Processing** - Updates one record at a time
3. **Cache Stampede** - Multiple API calls can trigger same populate
4. **No Query Optimization** - Missing indexes on key fields

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps After Fixes

### 1. Data Accuracy Verification
```sql
-- Compare reporting table vs Moodle DB
SELECT 
    'Reporting' as source,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT userid) as unique_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT courseid) as unique_courses
FROM mdl_local_alx_api_reporting
WHERE is_deleted = 0 AND companyid = ?

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Moodle DB' as source,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT u.id) as unique_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as unique_courses
FROM mdl_user u
JOIN mdl_company_users cu ON cu.userid = u.id
JOIN mdl_user_enrolments ue ON ue.userid = u.id
JOIN mdl_enrol e ON e.id = ue.enrolid
JOIN mdl_course c ON c.id = e.courseid
WHERE cu.companyid = ? AND u.deleted = 0 AND u.suspended = 0
```

### 2. Cache Verification
```php
// Test cache invalidation
$before = local_alx_report_api_cache_get($cache_key, $companyid);
local_alx_report_api_set_company_setting($companyid, 'course_10', 0);
$after = local_alx_report_api_cache_get($cache_key, $companyid);
assert($before !== $after, "Cache should be cleared after settings change");
```

### 3. Sync Verification
```php
// Test incremental sync catches new users
$before_count = $DB->count_records('local_alx_api_reporting', ['companyid' => $companyid]);
// Add new user and enroll
$after_sync = local_alx_report_api_sync_recent_changes($companyid, 1);
$after_count = $DB->count_records('local_alx_api_reporting', ['companyid' => $companyid]);
assert($after_count > $before_count, "New user should be synced");
```

## üéØ Conclusion

The data inconsistency issues reported by testers are caused by **8 distinct bugs** in the data flow pipeline. The most critical issues are:

1. **Cache not respecting configuration changes** (BUG #1)
2. **Sync missing new users** (BUG #3)  
3. **Deleted records still cached** (BUG #6)

These bugs explain why:
- ‚úÖ "It was working fine before" - Recent code changes introduced cache bugs
- ‚úÖ "Data doesn't match Moodle" - Percentage and status calculations are wrong
- ‚úÖ "Some users missing" - Sync doesn't catch new enrollments
- ‚úÖ "Deleted users still appear" - Cache not cleared on soft delete

**Recommended Action:** Implement Phase 1 fixes immediately (2 hours work) to restore data accuracy, then proceed with Phase 2 and 3 for complete resolution.
